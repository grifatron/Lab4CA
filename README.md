# Lab4CA
This lab focused on creating the components required to build an ALU. By using a mux's selector bits to determine which instruction set happens, information can be quickly calulated. An ALU is the arithmatic logic unit of the computer, and thus deals with data processing. After entering two 32 bits of data to the ALU, as well as a carry in and the 5 bit function select data, the ALU outputs the correct data. The ALU outputs a 32 bit output, as well as a 4 bit status number. The status data indicates whether or not there is an issue with the data, such as data overflow, the number being negative, the number being zero, or having a carry out bit. This bit is important for knowing whether or not an error occured.
